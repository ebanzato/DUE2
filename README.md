# DUE2

<!-- badges: start -->

Because everything about this method revolves around two: two stages,
two conditions, two perspectives on the same network.

*DUE2* — from the Italian “due” (two) and the sound “due to” — is a
two-step method for comparing two conditions and finding what changes
*due to* them.

The function `DUE2` implements a two-step algorithm that first performs
a screening for equality of node-conditional distributions and then
identifies the parameters responsible for the differences.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DUE2 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ebanzato/DUE2) with:
