# DUE2

Because everything about this method revolves around two: two stages, two conditions, two perspectives on the same network.

**DUE2** — from the Italian “due” (two) and the sound “due to” — is a two-step method for comparing graphs under two conditions and finding what changes *due to* them.

The function `DUE2` implements a two-step algorithm that first performs a screening for equality of node-conditional distributions and then identifies the parameters responsible for the differences.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DUE2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/ebanzato/DUE2) with:

``` r
